2. Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio.

### How to Play
1. The game consists of a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns marking a cell with their symbol (X or O).
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
5. You can reset the game at any time to start a new match.
